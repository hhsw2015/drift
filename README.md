**drift** is a single binary that lets you securely copy files and folders between two machines over WebSocket. It includes a built-in web UI with a two-pane file browser — no setup, no cloud, no SSH keys.

## Features

- Single self-contained binary (React frontend embedded)
- End-to-end encryption via X25519 key exchange + ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Optional password authentication
- Two-pane file browser UI (`hostname:/pwd` on each side) with multi-select (Cmd/Ctrl-click to toggle, Shift-click to range-select)
- Address bar with autocomplete — type paths and get suggestions for local and remote directories
- Large file support with chunked streaming and progress indication
- Recursive directory transfer (auto-compressed via tar.gz)
- Direct CLI file send mode (`--file`) — no web UI needed
- CLI commands to explore remote hosts (`ls`, `pull`) — no web UI needed
- Bidirectional — push files to remote **or** pull files from remote
- Both directions work from the browser UI (left pane = local, right pane = remote)
- One-click reconnect when the remote drops (works for CLI-launched sessions too)
- Zero configuration — just run it

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install aeroxy/tap/drift
```

### From source

```bash
# Requires Rust 1.82+ and bun (or npm)
git clone https://github.com/aeroxy/drift.git
cd drift
cargo build --release

# Binary at target/release/drift
```

## Usage

### Start a server

```bash
# Serve on port 8000, browsing the current directory
drift --port 8000

# Run in the background (logs → ./drift.log)
drift --port 8000 --daemon
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the file browser.

### Connect two machines

```bash
# Machine A (server)
drift --port 8000

# Machine B (connects to A)
drift --port 9000 --target 192.168.0.2:8000
```

Both machines now show a two-pane UI. Select files on either side and copy them across. Both `localhost:8000` and `localhost:9000` show each other's files.

### List files on a remote host

```bash
# List files at the root of a running drift server
drift ls --target 192.168.0.2:8000

# List a subdirectory
drift ls --target 192.168.0.2:8000 src
```

### Pull files from a remote host

```bash
# Pull a file
drift pull --target 192.168.0.2:8000 report.pdf

# Pull a directory (automatically decompressed)
drift pull --target 192.168.0.2:8000 my-project

# Pull to a specific output directory
drift pull --target 192.168.0.2:8000 data.csv --output /tmp/downloads
```

### Send a file directly (no web UI)

```bash
# Send a file to a running drift server
drift send --target 192.168.0.2:8000 video.mp4

# Send a folder (automatically compressed)
drift send --target 192.168.0.2:8000 ./my-project

# With password
drift send --target 192.168.0.2:8000 data.zip --password secret
```

This connects, transfers the file, prints progress, and exits. No web server is started.

### With password authentication

```bash
# Machine A
drift serve --port 8000 --password mysecret

# Machine B
drift serve --port 9000 --target 192.168.0.2:8000 --password mysecret
```

## Why WebSockets?

Many modern file transfer tools optimize for maximum throughput using UDP-based protocols (WebRTC DataChannels, QUIC, etc.). Those can be faster for large files, but they routinely fail in the environments where you actually need ad-hoc transfers.

drift prioritizes maximum compatibility and zero configuration:

- **Works out of the box on cloud GPU providers, serverless platforms, and inference hosts** — most only permit outbound HTTP/WebSocket; no firewall exceptions needed
- **Runs reliably inside Docker and Kubernetes pods** — no UDP, no port-forwarding, no network admin required
- **No auxiliary infrastructure** — no STUN/TURN servers, no hole-punching, no coordination service
- **Friction-free for AI agents** — agents can exchange code, CSVs, model weights, and logs without any setup beyond a single binary

**Trade-off:** TCP head-of-line blocking means slightly lower throughput on very large files compared to UDP-based solutions. For the primary use case — fast, secure exchange of artifacts between machines — this is an acceptable trade. Future versions may add optional QUIC/WebTransport support for less restricted environments.

## How It Works

1. **Machine A** starts a WebSocket server on the specified port
2. **Machine B** connects and performs an X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange
3. Both derive symmetric keys via HKDF-SHA256 (separate keys for each direction)
4. If `--password` is set, an HMAC challenge-response authenticates the peer
5. All subsequent messages are encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
6. Files are streamed in 64KB chunks over encrypted WebSocket binary frames
7. Folders are compressed to `.tar.gz` before transfer and extracted on the other side
8. The web UI at `localhost:<port>` shows both file trees side by side

### Protocol

| Frame Type | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Text (encrypted) | JSON `ControlMessage` | Browse, transfer control, progress |
| Binary (encrypted) | `[16B UUID][8B offset][chunk]` | File data |

Request/response control messages such as browse and info use correlation IDs so concurrent requests can be matched to the correct reply even if responses arrive out of order or a caller times out.

### Security

- **Forward secrecy**: ephemeral X25519 keys per session
- **Path traversal protection**: all paths are canonicalized and validated against the root directory
- **Authenticated encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 with monotonic nonce counters

## CLI Reference

```
drift <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]

Commands:
    serve   Start the drift server with web UI
    send    Send a file or folder to a remote drift server
    ls      List files on a remote drift server
    pull    Pull a file or folder from a remote drift server
```

### Commands

| Command | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `serve` | `drift serve --port 8000` | Starts web UI, waits for connections |
| `serve` | `drift serve --port 9000 --target host:8000` | Starts web UI and connects to remote |
| `send` | `drift send --target host:8000 video.mp4` | Sends file/folder and exits |
| `ls` | `drift ls --target host:8000 [path]` | Lists files on remote |
| `pull` | `drift pull --target host:8000 file.txt` | Pulls file/folder from remote |

Legacy flat args (`drift --port 8000`, `drift --target host --file path`) are still supported for backward compatibility.

## Development

```bash
# Frontend dev server (hot reload)
cd frontend && bun dev

# Rust backend (in another terminal)
cargo run -- --port 8000

# Build everything (frontend + backend)
cargo build
```

The `build.rs` script automatically builds the React frontend before compiling Rust. The built assets are embedded in the binary via `rust-embed`.

### Testing

Integration tests live in `frontend/test/`. They start real drift instances, transfer files via WebSocket, and verify MD5 checksums.

**Set up test-resources** (not committed — create your own):

```
test-resources/
├── host/           # Put at least one subdirectory with files here (tests folder transfer)
│   └── some-dir/
│       └── file.ext
└── client/         # Put at least one file here (tests file transfer)
    └── file.ext
```

Any files work — the tests discover entries dynamically. The host directory should contain at least one **subdirectory** to exercise the tar.gz folder transfer path.

```bash
# Run integration tests (builds cargo first)
cd frontend && bun run test
```

The test suite:
1. Backs up `test-resources/` → `test-resources-bak/`
2. Starts two drift instances (host + client) on random ports
3. Pushes host files to client and client files to host via WebSocket
4. Verifies MD5 checksums of all transferred files
5. Verifies `.drift/` temp directories are cleaned up
6. Restores `test-resources/` from backup
